/**
 * Portal identity, mobile-handoff bootstrap, and role enforcement.
 * =====================================================================
 * This file is deliberately IDENTICAL in the Admin and Manager repos
 * except for the PORTAL_ID / PORTAL_LABEL constants directly below. If
 * you change anything else here, copy the change to the other repo too -
 * the two halves of the check only work when they agree.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * Until now neither portal checked *who* was signing in. Both accepted
 * any valid credential from the shared backend and rendered their own UI
 * around it. The Manager portal in particular had no role logic anywhere
 * - not in App.jsx, not in AuthContext, not in Layout - so an admin
 * account that reached it (from the mobile shell, from a bookmark, or
 * from a stale tab) was shown the Manager portal with admin credentials.
 * That is the "logging in as admin opens the Manager portal and the
 * credentials collapse into each other" problem.
 *
 * Two things fix it, and both live here:
 *
 *   1. The mobile handoff now carries an explicit `portal` marker saying
 *      which portal the shell meant to reach. If this portal is not that
 *      portal, the session is NOT written to localStorage here; it is
 *      forwarded on to the correct portal instead (bounded by a hop
 *      counter so a misconfiguration cannot become an infinite loop).
 *      This makes the app self-healing even if the two Vercel projects
 *      were deployed to each other's URLs.
 *
 *   2. roleBelongsHere() backs that up for every other way in - a normal
 *      browser login on the wrong site, a restored localStorage session,
 *      a shared link. App.jsx uses it to refuse the session outright
 *      rather than render the wrong portal.
